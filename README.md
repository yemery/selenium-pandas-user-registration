# User Registration Automation
### This Python script automates user registration on a web application using Selenium. It reads user data from a CSV file, fills out the registration form, and logs the progress. The script uses the Chrome WebDriver and interacts with the web application by entering user information. It checks for existing users and resumes registration from the last pint if interrupted.
